How to install Version 1.01 of ConfigDig:

1. Verify that you have the pre-requisite perl modules installed:

	Net::SMTP
	Date::Manip
	Text::Template
	File::Spec (this should be part of base perl installation)

You can pick these up at your closest CPAN (www.cpan.org has a
list of sites).

2. Install the the ConfigDig modules by entering the following commands:
	tar xvfz HtDig-Config-1.01.tar.gz
	cd HtDig-Config-1.01.tar.gz
	perl Makefile.PL  (enter PREFIX=dir if you wish to install the
				modules in "dir" instead of the main
				perl library directory)
	make
	make install
	perl installer.pl

When installer.pl is run, it will install the cgi scripts into the
directory of your choice and will initialize the ConfigDig registry. In
addition, it allows you to configure the CGI scripts if you have installed
the modules into a custom directory.

For those of you who prefer to know what is going on behind the scenes,
the installer.pl script does the following:

	*Gathers information on the location of the ht://Dig base
		install directory, the ht://Dig conf directory, and 
		an acceptable location for ConfigDig to store its log
		files.
	*Creates a ConfigDig registry file (configdig_sites.pl) in
		your ht://Dig conf directory.  It presets the values for
		the ConfigDig log directory, and the ht://Dig base
		directory to the paths provided earlier in the
		installation process.
	*Moves the contents of the ./cgi subdirectory into the
		designated CGI directory.  The destination directory
		 must be configured by your web server to be CGI 
		executible.  Refer to your server documentation for how to
		do this.
	*Modifies cgi_settings.pl in the cgi directory so that the
		perl variable $conf_path contains the path to
		configdig_sites.pl
	*Optionally modifies local_inc.pl in the cgi directory so that it
		adds a custom ConfigDig modules location to perl's
		module search path.

3. Test the installation by running the index.cgi page on your web
site using your web browser.

4. As soon as you see the application is running successfully, click into
the "Modify Global Settings" area and verify that your base ht://Dig
installation directory is correct, as well as ConfigDig log files
location.  The ConfigDig log files can be referred to later to view the
outcome of index generation and dig processes that you have initiated from
the web application.

FURTHER ASSISTANCE:  Problems can be logged on the ConfigDig web site's
bug tracking system at configdig.sourceforge.net and will be addressed as
quickly as possible.

I hope you find ConfigDig useful!
